  <h1>Research</h1>

  <p>Since September 2018, I have been a graduate researcher working with Professors <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/">Maryam Fazel</a> and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/">Lillian Ratliff</a>.</p>

  <p>From August 2016 to May 2018, I was an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://wifo.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BLISS</a> lab, working under <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/">Professor Anant Sahai</a>. I worked primarily with graduate student Vidya Muthukumar. We looked at problems in sequential decision making, for stochastic and adversarial settings.</p>

  <p>From August 2015 to July 2016, I was an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/">Maharbiz Group</a>, under <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/maharbiz.html">Professor Michel Maharbiz</a>, as part of the <a href="https://swarmlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Swarm Lab</a>. I worked primarily with graduate student Travis Massey. Travis is working on a microwire array which can be inserted into the brain to extract useful information. The device is made of carbon fiber tubes inserted into a silicon substrate. This is at the micron scale for minimal tissue damage. My work was primarily on the software side of a robot that automated the process of feeding the carbon fiber tubes into the holes on the silicon substrate.</p>

  <p>From September 2012 to September 2013, I was a research intern at the <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS/NIH)</a> in the <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/">Biostatistics Branch</a>. I worked with <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/shockley/index.cfm">Dr. Keith Shockley</a> and <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/kissling/index.cfm">Dr. Grace Kissling</a>. We proposed a normalization technique to reduce systematic error in quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) data. I was awarded <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts">Intel Science Talent Search (STS)</a> semifinalist for this work.</p>
