  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Mitas, and I'm a third year <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS</a> student at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>.</p>

  <p>I am an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/">Maharbiz Group</a>, under <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/maharbiz.html">Professor Michel Maharbiz</a>, as part of the <a href="https://swarmlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Swarm Lab</a>. I am also an undergraduate student instructor for <a href="http://cs61a.org/">CS 61A</a>. Previously, I was a tutor/reader for <a href="http://cs61b.ug/sp16/">CS 61B</a>.</p>

  <p>I am from North Carolina, so I enjoy southern barbecue and any fried and buttery foods. In addition, I enjoy playing and watching basketball and football.</p>

  <p>Feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:mitas.ray@berkeley.edu">email</a>.</p>
