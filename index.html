  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Mitas, and I'm a first year <a href="https://www.ece.uw.edu/">ECE</a> PhD student at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. I am advised by Professors <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/mfazel/">Maryam Fazel</a> and <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ratliffl/">Lillian Ratliff</a>.</p>

  <p>Previously, I completed my undergrad at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> studying <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">EECS</a>. I was an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://wifo.eecs.berkeley.edu/">BLISS</a> lab, working with PhD student <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vidya.muthukumar/">Vidya Muthukumar</a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/">Professor Anant Sahai</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/">Maharbiz Group</a>, working with PhD stduent Travis Massey and <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/maharbiz.html">Professor Michel Maharbiz</a>, as part of the <a href="https://swarmlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Swarm Lab</a>. 

  <p>During my undergrad years at UC Berkeley, I was a lecturer / instructor on record for <a href="http://su18.cs61a.org/">CS 61A</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate student instructor (uGSI) for CS 61A. Throughout my time there, I was also a uGSI for <a href="http://datastructur.es/sp17">CS 61B</a> and a tutor/reader for CS 61B.</p>

  <p>I am from North Carolina, so I enjoy southern barbecue and any fried and buttery foods. In addition, I enjoy playing and watching basketball and football.</p>

  <p>Feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:mitasray@uw.edu">email</a>.</p>
